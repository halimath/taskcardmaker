*Taskcardmaker* is an Google App Engine hosted web application that
provides an easy to use editor to create story and taskcards typically
used by agile software development teams that use scrum, kanban or a similar 
method.

Taskcardmaker provides an easy to use editor with a preview system that can be 
used in team meetings when tasks are written (such as a sprint planning 
meeting). When all tasks have been collected taskcardmaker can generate a PDF 
document ready for printing to bring the task and story cards to your agile 
planning board.

Taskcardmaker can be used online free of charge at
